static assets for projects used in shadow wizard mone gang projects

----------------------------------------------------------------

the javascript code for the bmz pop up can be found here

[https://sijirama.github.io/static/js/widget.done.js](https://sijirama.github.io/static/js/widget.done.js)

but the cdn uploaded link can always be regenerated here:

[https://cdn.statically.io/gh/shadow-wizards/static/main/bmz/widget.prod.js](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/shadow-wizards/static/main/bmz/widget.prod.js)

the code to be embedded in the user head tag will then be 

```html
    <script data-name="BMC-Widget" data-cfasync="false"
        src="https://sijirama.github.io/static/js/widget.done.js"
        data-id="sijiramakun"
        data-description="buy me some fucking zobo!" 
        data-message="" 
        data-color="#5F7FFF" 
        data-position="Right"
        data-x_margin="18" 
        data-y_margin="18"
    ></script>
```

but the src should be changed to the present widget js file

we need to build our assets tbh, we still use alot from bmc

github links to be transferred to cdn links can be uploaded here on [statically](https://statically.io/convert/)
